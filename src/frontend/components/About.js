          Here at UniRecs, we want to make where you go to college an easy process.
          We start every user with an initial questionnaire that assesses the interests of students,
          both academic and extracurricular-wise.
          Depending on how the student responds, we curate a list
          of colleges that would fit the student's interests. Currently, we support over 200 US national universities recognized
          by the U.S. News and World Report 2023 Rankings along with the 2023 National Liberal Arts College Rankings.
