      <h2>Demystifying various questions of high school seniors everywhere:</h2>
      <h4>Where can I go to college based on my interests?</h4>
      <h4>Can I afford it?</h4>
      <h4>Am I competitve among applicants?</h4>
      <h4>In-state vs. out-of-state?</h4>

      <h2>And so much more...</h2>

        Here at UniRecs, we want to make where you go to college an easy process.
        We start every user with an initial questionnaire that assesses the interests of students,
        both academic and extracurricular-wise. <br />
        Depending on how the student responds, we curate a list
        of colleges that would fit his, her, or their interests. Currently, we support over 200 US national universities recognized
        by the U.S. News and World Report 2023 Rankings. We plan on adding the dataset for USNews's 2023 National Liberal College Rankings
        in the near future (all datasets courtesy of Andrew G. Reiter,
        “U.S. News & World Report Historical Liberal Arts College and University Rankings,”
        available at: http://andyreiter.com/datasets/).
