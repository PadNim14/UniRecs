Undergraduate full-time tuition, required fees, room and board
List the typical tuition, required fees, and room and board for a full-time undergraduate student for the FULL 
2022-2023 academic year. (30 semester hours or 45 quarter hours for institutions that derive annual tuition 
by multiplying credit hour cost by number of credits). 
•     A full academic year refers to the period of time generally extending from September to June; usually 
      equated to two semesters, two trimesters, three quarters, or the period covered by a four-one-four plan. 
•     Room and board is defined as double occupancy and 19 meals per week or the maximum meal plan. 
•     Required fees include only charges that all full-time students must pay that are not included in tuition 
      (e.g., registration, health, or activity fees.) 
Check here if your institution's 
2022-2023 academic year costs of attendance are not available at this time 
and provide an approximate date (i.e., month/day) when your institution's final 2022-2023 academic year 
costs of attendance will be available:
•     Do not include optional fees (e.g., parking, laboratory use).
Comprehensive tuition and room and board fee (if your college cannot provide 
separate tuition and room and board fees):
Provide 2022-2023 academic year costs of attendance for the following categories that are applicable 
to your institution.
Undergraduate per-credit-hour charges (tuition only): 
Number of credits per term a student can take for the stated 
full-time tuition.
Do tuition and fees vary by year of study (e.g., sophomore, 
junior, senior)?
Do tuition and fees vary by undergraduate instructional 
program?

H. FINANCIAL AID
Please refer to the following financial aid definitions when completing Section H.
Awarded aid: The dollar amounts offered to financial aid applicants.
Financial aid applicant: Any applicant who submits any one of the institutionally required financial aid 
applications/forms, such as the FAFSA. 
Indebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan program (federal, state, subsidized, 
unsubsidized, private, etc.; excluding parent loans) while the student was enrolled at an institution. Student 
loans co-signed by a parent are assumed to be the responsibility of the student and should be included.
Note: Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:
6. Non-need outside grants
7. Non-need student loans
8. Non-need parent loans
9. Non-need work
Non-need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, or other sources for which a 
student need not demonstrate financial need to qualify.
Institutional scholarships and grants: Endowed scholarships, annual gifts and tuition funded grants for 
which the institution determines the recipient.
Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's 
own standards.
Need-based aid:
 College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other 
sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify. This includes both institutional and non-
institutional student aid (grants, jobs, and loans).
Need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or other 
sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify.
Need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a 
student must demonstrate financial need to qualify.
Non-need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants, gifts, or merit-based aid from 
institutional, state, federal, or other sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income) 
awarded solely on the basis of academic achievement, merit, or any other non-need-based reason. When 
reporting questions H1 and H2, non-need-based aid that is used to meet need should be counted as need-
based aid. 
Enter total dollar amounts awarded to enrolled full-time and less than full-time degree-seeking 
undergraduates (using the same cohort reported in CDS Question B1, “total degree-seeking” 
undergraduates) in the following categories.
•     If the data being reported are final figures for the 2020-2021 academic year (see the next item below), 
      use the 2020-2021 academic year's CDS Question B1 cohort.
•     Include aid awarded to international students (i.e., those not qualifying for federal aid). 
•     Aid that is non-need-based but that was used to meet need should be reported in the need-based aid 
      column.
•     For a suggested order of precedence in assigning categories of aid to cover need, see the entry for 
“non-
                            
•     Do NOT include any aid related to the CARES Act or unique to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Private student loans: A nonfederal loan made by a lender such as a bank, credit union or private lender 
used to pay for up to the annual cost of education, less any financial aid received.
External scholarships and grants: Scholarships and grants received from outside (private) sources that 
students bring with them (e.g., Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution may process 
paperwork to receive the dollars, but it has no role in determining the recipient or the dollar amount 
Work study and employment: Federal and state work study aid, and any employment packaged by your 
institution in financial aid awards.

I. INSTRUCTIONAL FACULTY AND CLASS SIZE
The following definition of full-time instructional faculty is used by the American Association of University Professors 
(AAUP) in its annual Faculty Compensation Survey (the part time definitions are not used by AAUP). Instructional 
Faculty is defined as those members of the instructional-research staff whose major regular assignment is instruction, 
including those with released time for research. Use the chart below to determine inclusions and exclusions:
Total number of instructional faculty
Full-time instructional faculty: faculty employed on a full-time basis for instruction (including those with released 
time for research)
Part-time instructional faculty: Adjuncts and other instructors being paid solely for part-time classroom instruction. 
Also includes full-time faculty teaching less than two semesters, three quarters, two trimesters, or two four-month 
sessions. Employees who are not considered full-time instruction faculty but who teach one or more non-clinical credit 
courses may be counted as part-time faculty.
Minority faculty: includes faculty who designate themselves as Black, non-Hispanic; American Indian or Alaska 
Native; Asian, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, or Hispanic. 
Doctorate: includes such degrees as Doctor of Philosophy, Doctor of Education, Doctor of Juridical Science, and 
Doctor of Public Health in any field such as arts, sciences, education, engineering, business, and public 
administration. Also includes terminal degrees formerly designated as “first professional,” including dentistry (DDS or 
DMD), medicine (MD), optometry (OD), osteopathic medicine (DO), pharmacy (DPharm or BPharm), podiatric 
medicine (DPM), veterinary medicine (DVM), chiropractic (DC or DCM), or law (JD).  
Terminal master’s degree: a master’s degree that is considered the highest degree in a field: example, M. Arch (in 
architecture) and MFA (master of fine arts in art or theater).
Instructional faculty in preclinical and clinical medicine, faculty who are not paid (e.g., 
those who donate their services or are in the military), or research-only faculty, post-
doctoral fellows, or pre-doctoral fellows
Replacement faculty for faculty on sabbatical leave or leave with pay
Undergraduate or graduate students who assist in the instruction of courses, but have 
titles such as teaching assistant, teaching fellow, and the like
Faculty on sabbatical or leave with pay
Faculty on leave without pay
Please report the number of instructional faculty members in each category for Fall 2021. Include 
faculty who are on your institution’s payroll on the census date your institution uses for 
IPEDS/AAUP.
Administrative officers with titles such as dean of students, librarian, registrar, coach, 
and the like, even though they may devote part of their time to classroom instruction 
and may have faculty status

CLASS SUB-
SECTIONS
Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class 
sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2021. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who 
met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the “100+” column in 
the class section column and 40 times under the “20-29” column of the class subsections table. 
Class Subsections:  A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, 
recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet 
separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any 
subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, 
exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music 
instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be 
duplicated because of cross-listings.
In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and 
class sections offered in the Fall 2021 term.
•     Please include classes that have been moved online in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Class Sections:  A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and 
number, meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a 
laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at 
least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes 
and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, 
or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign 
language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section 
should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.

For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and bachelor’s degrees awarded. To 
determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a double major will be represented twice). 
Calculate the percentage from your institution’s IPEDS Completions by using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code as the 
numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as the denominator. If you prefer, you can 
compute the percentages using 1st majors only.
